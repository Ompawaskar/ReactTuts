Today i learnt reusable components , props and bit of tailwind css.
We can pass objects,arrays as props.
Usually when we receive props we destructure them.
I also learnt two concepts about useState that:
1. It receives all changes to be done in form of a bundle.
2. It always has a callback function which executes and changes state.
