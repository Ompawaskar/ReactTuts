In this tutorial we tried to create our own js library like react.
First and foremost I created a index.html file and made a wrapper div root and linked the js file to my html.
Then we created a customreact.js file.
Then we created a customRender function which rendered a user defined element into my container.

We then moved to main.jsx and realised that the components we rendered are just functions which return a html element. We can directly execute the function instead of component.
Then we created a React element and rendered it directly.
React converts Html elements into a certain format and we provided our element in that format beforehand.
